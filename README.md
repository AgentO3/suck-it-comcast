Suck It Comcast!!!
===============

Comcast sucks!!! Hours of your life stolen by waiting on hold for customer support, over charging you for basic cable service, slowly raising you cable bill but not getting any additional value in return, and constantly canceling appointments without any notice. These are just a couple of things that Comcast just flat out fails to get right. Stick it to them by using these hacks to make sure you are getting everything you can for your dollar.

1. Do you feel like your spending too much for just basic cable services? You can get premium channels for the same amount you are paying for basic services. Just call and ask for the current promtion. Comcast has to give you whatever the promtion they give to new customers. Example, I pay $140 a month for internet and cable with all the premium channels and DVR.
